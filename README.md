News Club was my final project of the Le Wagon Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp in 2019. The concept was to be a subscription service, which would give you access to a small number of online articles each month from a lot of newspapers and magazines.

The app featured an integration with an external API that provided headlines and links from online publications, a user login and a subscription form. The aesthetics were a combination of Google Material Design components and a neat CMYK-themed colour scheme.
